# SEAD Sharding Capability Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan establishes comprehensive sharding capabilities for SEAD-METHOD to manage large documents and catalog resources within context window limits. The goal is to create a standardized, catalog-aware sharding system that integrates with SEAD's constitutional framework.

## Current Sharding Status ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

### Implementation Complete
- **✅ 6 workflows** can execute `shard_constitutional_documents` action  
- **✅ 4 agents** have sharding capabilities via `shard-doc` command
- **✅ Core task file** `sead-core/tasks/sead-shard-doc.md` implemented with comprehensive functionality
- **✅ BMAD integration** leverages `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` with manual fallback
- **✅ Two sharding types**: PRD story-focused + Catalog pattern discovery

### Delivered Components
