## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Story Creation Hierarchy Changes

**sead-product-owner.md:**
```yaml
# PRIMARY STORY CREATION AUTHORITY - Other agents delegate story/epic creation here
- create-epic: Create catalog-aware epic for projects
- create-story: Create user story from requirements
- create-brownfield-epic: Create epic for brownfield projects  
- create-brownfield-story: Create brownfield story
```

**sead-project-manager.md:**
```yaml
# STORY CREATION - Delegate to sead-product-owner for all story/epic creation
# Use: "Please use sead-product-owner for story and epic creation - they have primary authority"
# - create-epic ‚Üí Delegate to sead-product-owner
# - create-brownfield-epic ‚Üí Delegate to sead-product-owner
# - create-story ‚Üí Delegate to sead-product-owner
# - create-brownfield-story ‚Üí Delegate to sead-product-owner
```

**sead-scrum-master.md:**
```yaml
# PRIMARY STORY CREATION - Delegate to sead-product-owner
# Use: "Please use sead-product-owner for new story/epic creation - I focus on decomposition"
- draft: Execute task sead-create-next-story.md (story decomposition from epics, not primary creation)
```

### Catalog Operations Centralization Changes

**sead-catalog-architect.md:**
```yaml
# CENTRALIZED CATALOG OPERATIONS (moved from other agents)
- catalog-dependency-analysis: Analyze dependencies on catalog patterns (from sead-product-owner)
- pattern-impact-analysis: Analyze impact of catalog pattern changes (from sead-product-owner)
- link-catalog: Connect artifacts to specific catalog components (from sead-scrum-master)
- pattern-capture: Capture new patterns for catalog promotion (from sead-scrum-master)
- catalog-validation: Technical validation of catalog integrity (from sead-architect)
```

**Other Agents - Delegation Comments:**
```yaml
# CATALOG OPERATIONS - Delegate complex operations to sead-catalog-architect
# - operation-name ‚Üí Use sead-catalog-architect for complex analysis
```
