# Phase 4: Agent Role Optimization Analysis

## Overview
Phase 4 focuses on optimizing agent roles to eliminate overlap and establish clear responsibilities. This analysis examines current agent command overlap and proposes optimization strategies.

## Task 1: Story Creation Hierarchy Analysis

### Current Overlap Problem
**Identical Commands Across Multiple Agents:**

| Command | Product Owner | Scrum Master | Project Manager |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `create-epic` | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| `create-story` | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| `create-brownfield-epic` | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| `create-brownfield-story` | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| `draft` (create-next-story) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |

**Overlap Issues:**
- Product Owner and Project Manager have 100% identical story creation commands
- Creates confusion about which agent to use for story creation
- Duplicates responsibility and maintenance overhead
- Unclear authority in story creation decisions

### Proposed Hierarchy Solution

#### üìù **sead-product-owner** - PRIMARY STORY CREATOR
**Role:** Business-focused story creation with catalog awareness
**Responsibilities:**
- ‚úÖ `create-epic` - Business-driven epic creation with catalog patterns
- ‚úÖ `create-story` - User story creation from requirements 
- ‚úÖ `create-brownfield-epic` - Legacy system epic planning
- ‚úÖ `create-brownfield-story` - Legacy integration stories
- ‚úÖ Story validation and acceptance criteria definition
- ‚úÖ Backlog prioritization and refinement

#### üèÉ **sead-scrum-master** - STORY DECOMPOSITION & SPRINT PLANNING  
**Role:** Technical story breakdown and sprint coordination
**Responsibilities:**
- ‚úÖ `draft` (create-next-story) - Story decomposition from epics
- ‚úÖ Story refinement for technical clarity
- ‚úÖ Sprint planning and story assignment
- ‚úÖ Story validation against technical constraints
- ‚ùå PRIMARY story creation (delegates to Product Owner)

#### üìã **sead-project-manager** - EPIC-LEVEL COORDINATION
**Role:** High-level project coordination and dependency management
**Responsibilities:**
- ‚úÖ Epic-level dependency analysis
- ‚úÖ Cross-team coordination
- ‚úÖ Resource planning and timeline management
- ‚úÖ Stakeholder communication
- ‚ùå Direct story/epic creation (delegates to Product Owner)

### Command Optimization Plan

#### Product Owner - Enhanced Commands (Keep All)
```yaml
commands:
  # Primary Story Creation Authority
  - create-epic: Create catalog-aware epic for projects
  - create-story: Create user story from requirements with catalog patterns
  - create-brownfield-epic: Create epic for brownfield projects
  - create-brownfield-story: Create brownfield story with existing patterns
  
  # Story Management
  - validate-story-draft: Validate story against catalog compliance
  - story-refinement: Refine stories for catalog compliance
  - acceptance-criteria: Define mode-appropriate acceptance criteria
  
  # Backlog Management
  - backlog-prioritization: Prioritize based on catalog efficiency
  - sprint-planning: Plan sprints with catalog pattern availability
  - pattern-impact-analysis: Analyze impact of catalog changes
```

#### Scrum Master - Focused Commands (Remove Duplicates)
```yaml
commands:
  # Story Decomposition (Not Creation)
  - draft: Execute create-next-story (decompose epics into stories)
  - story-checklist: Validate story draft against checklist
  - validate-constraints: Check story against SEAD mode constraints
  
  # Technical Story Enhancement
  - link-catalog: Connect story to specific catalog components
  - mode-requirements: Generate mode-appropriate criteria
  - pattern-capture: Capture new patterns for catalog promotion
  
  # REMOVED COMMANDS (delegate to Product Owner):
  # - create-epic (Product Owner responsibility)
  # - create-story (Product Owner responsibility)
```

#### Project Manager - Strategic Commands (Remove Story Creation)
```yaml
commands:
  # Strategic Planning
  - create-prd: Create Product Requirements Document
  - create-brownfield-prd: Create brownfield PRD
  - project-planning: Comprehensive project planning
  - roadmap-planning: Product roadmap with catalog evolution
  
  # Coordination & Management  
  - resource-planning: Plan resources with catalog efficiency
  - risk-assessment: Mode-based risk assessment
  - milestone-planning: Project milestones with mode progression
  - stakeholder-communication: Updates with catalog compliance
  
  # REMOVED COMMANDS (delegate to Product Owner):
  # - create-epic (Product Owner responsibility)
  # - create-story (Product Owner responsibility)
  # - create-brownfield-epic (Product Owner responsibility)
  # - create-brownfield-story (Product Owner responsibility)
```

## Task 2: Catalog Operations Centralization Analysis

### Current Catalog Command Distribution

| Agent | Catalog Commands |
|-------|------------------|
| sead-product-owner | `catalog-scan`, `catalog-dependency-analysis`, `pattern-impact-analysis` |
| sead-scrum-master | `catalog-scan`, `link-catalog`, `pattern-capture` |
| sead-project-manager | `catalog-scan` |
| sead-architect | `catalog-scan`, `catalog-validation` |
| sead-catalog-architect | `catalog-scan`, `bootstrap-catalog`, `validate-catalog`, `pattern-lifecycle` |

### Proposed Centralization: sead-catalog-architect

#### Enhanced sead-catalog-architect (Central Authority)
```yaml
commands:
  # Core Catalog Operations
  - catalog-scan: Comprehensive catalog analysis
  - bootstrap-catalog: Initialize catalog structure
  - validate-catalog: Validate catalog integrity
  - pattern-lifecycle: Manage pattern lifecycle
  
  # Extended Operations (from other agents)
  - catalog-dependency-analysis: Analyze dependencies (from Product Owner)
  - pattern-impact-analysis: Analyze pattern change impact (from Product Owner)
  - link-catalog: Connect artifacts to catalog components (from Scrum Master)
  - pattern-capture: Capture new patterns for promotion (from Scrum Master)
  - catalog-validation: Technical validation (from Architect)
```

#### Other Agents - Simplified Catalog Interface
- **Basic `catalog-scan`** - Read-only catalog querying
- **Delegate complex operations** to sead-catalog-architect
- **Use catalog references** in their artifacts without direct manipulation

## Task 3: Document Management Rationalization Analysis

### Current Document Creation Overlap

| Document Type | Multiple Agents Creating |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Architecture Documents | sead-architect, sead-project-manager |
| Requirements/Specs | sead-product-owner, sead-project-manager, sead-analyst |
| Analysis Reports | sead-analyst, sead-architect, sead-qa |
| Validation Reports | sead-qa, sead-scrum-master, sead-architect |

### Proposed Document Ownership

#### üèóÔ∏è sead-architect - Technical Architecture
- Architecture documents (all types)
- Technical specifications
- System design documents
- Integration specifications

#### üìù sead-product-owner - Requirements & Product Specs
- Product Requirements Documents (PRD)
- User stories and epics
- Acceptance criteria
- Feature specifications

#### üîç sead-analyst - Research & Analysis
- Research reports
- Analysis documents
- Feasibility studies
- Requirements analysis

#### ‚úÖ sead-qa - Quality & Validation
- Quality reports
- Validation documents
- Test specifications
- Compliance reports
