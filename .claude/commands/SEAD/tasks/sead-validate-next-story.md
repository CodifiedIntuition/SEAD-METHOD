# SEAD Validate Next Story Task

## Purpose

To comprehensively validate a SEAD story draft before implementation begins, ensuring it is complete, accurate, catalog-compliant, constitutionally sound, and provides sufficient context for successful development with preserved agent context. This task identifies issues and gaps that need to be addressed, preventing hallucinations while ensuring catalog compliance and implementation readiness.

## SEAD Mode Awareness

This validation task operates with mode-sensitive criteria:
- **PROTOTYPE Mode**: Basic completeness, pattern documentation validation
- **DEVELOPMENT Mode**: Catalog compliance assessment, extension validation, comprehensive testing
- **BUILD-TO-DEPLOY Mode**: Strict catalog adherence, zero deviation tolerance, complete validation
