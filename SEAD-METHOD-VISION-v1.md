# SEAD-METHOD™: Specification Enforced Agentic Agile Development

**Version**: 1.4 Phase 3 Agent Ecosystem Complete  
**Date**: 2025-01-04 (Final Update)  
**Status**: 12-Agent SEAD Ecosystem Complete - Full Development Capability Operational

## Executive Summary

SEAD-METHOD™ (Specification Enforced Agentic Agile Development) is a hybrid methodology that combines the best of BMAD-METHOD's agentic workflow orchestration with Spec-Kit's constitutional specification-driven development, enhanced by a revolutionary **catalog-based constraint enforcement system**.

**Core Problem Solved**: AI agents lose context between sessions, leading to code/spec drift, inconsistent implementations, and deployment failures.

**Core Solution**: A catalog-based constraint system with three progressive development modes that prevent drift rather than just detecting it, plus automated catalog generation from existing codebases and prototype development.

## Vision Statement

Transform software development into a **factory assembly line approach** where AI agents work within progressively stricter constraints, using a comprehensive catalog of approved components, contracts, and patterns. Enable teams to choose their balance of creativity vs. consistency based on project phase: unlimited experimentation in prototypes, controlled innovation in development, and strict compliance for production deployment.

## Three-Tier Architecture

SEAD-METHOD operates on three aligned tiers that progress from maximum flexibility to maximum consistency:

### Development Modes
| Mode | Purpose | Constraints | AI Behavior | Validation |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **PROTOTYPE** 🧪 | Rapid experimentation | Minimal - can deviate from catalog | Creative, allows custom solutions | Basic linting |
| **DEVELOPMENT** ⚙️ | Production-ready features | Must use catalog when available, can extend | Prefers catalog, documents new patterns | Type checking, contract validation |
| **BUILD-TO-DEPLOY** 🏭 | Deployment-ready | STRICT - only catalog items | Assembly-line approach, no custom code | Full compliance checking |

### Data Strategy
| Tier | Storage | Schema | Purpose | Extensions |
|------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| **DEMO** 🎭 | SQLite/JSON | Full production + experimental | Rapid prototyping | ✅ Add freely |
| **MOCK** 🏗️ | Production-like (PostgreSQL) | Production + tracked extensions | Development testing | ⚙️ Track for migration |
| **PRODUCTION** 🏭 | Production database | Catalog-only (no extensions) | Live validation | ❌ Blocked |

### Deployment Strategy
| Tier | Infrastructure | Complexity | Sharing | Validation |
|------|---------------|------------|---------|------------|
| **LOCAL-DEV** 🏠 | Docker Compose | Minimal | Tunnels, local cloud | Health checks |
| **CLOUD-STAGING** ☁️ | Lightweight cloud | Moderate | Branch environments | Integration tests |
| **PRODUCTION-DEPLOY** 🏭 | Full production stack | Complete CI/CD | Blue/green deployment | Full validation |

## The Catalog System

### Agent-Driven Catalog Generation Strategy

SEAD-METHOD uses specialized AI agents instead of rigid scripts for intelligent catalog creation:

**1. Brownfield Analysis**: AI agents analyze existing codebases for pattern extraction
```bash
# Agent-driven catalog generation from existing codebase
sead catalog generate --source ./existing-project --interactive
# Activates: SEAD Catalog Architect + SEAD Pattern Extraction agents
```

**2. Greenfield Bootstrap**: Build catalog incrementally during prototype development
```bash
# Initialize with pattern tracking during development
sead catalog init --mode greenfield --track-patterns
# Capture patterns during implementation
/sead-implement story-001 --mode prototype --capture-patterns
```

**Key Innovation**: AI agents provide intelligent pattern recognition, quality assessment, and catalog organization - far superior to automated script-based extraction.

```

**Agent Capabilities**:
- **SEAD Catalog Architect (Morgan)**: Analyzes project structure, designs catalog taxonomy, guides interactive creation
- **SEAD Pattern Extraction (Quinn)**: Identifies patterns across domains, assesses quality, prepares catalog-ready components
- **Coordinated Workflow**: 5-phase process from initial analysis through adoption strategy

### Constraint Enforcement Mechanisms

#### 1. Catalog Reference System
- Every component gets unique catalog ID
- Agent instructions include relevant catalog IDs
- Context preserved across sessions via catalog references

#### 2. Mode-Based Constraint Injection
- Development mode constraints automatically injected into agent prompts
- Constitutional rules enforced at each handoff
- Validation gates prevent progression without compliance

#### 3. Progressive Validation Pipeline

graph TD
    A[Agent Output] --> B{Mode Check}
    B -->|Prototype| C[Basic Validation]
    B -->|Development| D[Catalog Compliance Check]
    B -->|Build-to-Deploy| E[Strict Validation Gate]
    
    C --> F[Continue]
    D --> G{Catalog Match?}
    E --> H{100% Compliant?}
    
    G -->|Yes| F
    G -->|No| I[Extend Catalog + Continue]
    H -->|Yes| F  
    H -->|No| J[Block - Fix Required]
```

## Integrated SEAD Workflow

### Phase 1: Constitutional Specification
```bash
/specify [feature description] --mode [prototype|development|build-to-deploy] --deploy-target [local|cloud|production]
```
**Enhanced Spec-Kit Process:**
- Creates feature spec using constitutional templates
- Checks catalog for relevant patterns based on mode
- BMAD Analyst validates business requirements
- Identifies data and deployment requirements
- **Output**: Feature spec + mode constraints + data requirements + deployment strategy

### Phase 2: Agentic Planning  
```bash
/plan [tech stack] --catalog-mode [mode] --data-tier [demo|mock|production] --deploy-tier [local-dev|cloud-staging|production-deploy]
```
**Enhanced BMAD Process:**
- BMAD Architect creates technical plan using catalog constraints
- Data Architect designs data layer with tier-appropriate patterns
- Infrastructure Architect designs deployment strategy
- Spec-Kit research agents validate technical choices
- Context preservation through catalog references
- **Output**: Implementation plan + data architecture + deployment architecture + catalog inventory

### Phase 3: Constraint-Aware Story Creation
```bash
/stories --enforce-catalog --data-tier [tier] --deploy-tier [tier]
```
**Context-Preserved Story Creation:**
- BMAD Scrum Master creates detailed stories with catalog references
- Each story includes data setup and deployment validation requirements
- Stories embed catalog compliance checks
- Context window preserved through catalog IDs
- **Output**: Stories with embedded catalog + data + deployment constraints

### Phase 4: Catalog-Driven Implementation
```bash
/implement [story-id] --mode [mode] --data-tier [tier] --deploy-tier [tier]
```
**Assembly-Line Implementation:**
- BMAD Dev agent implements using catalog constraints
- Mode determines flexibility vs. strictness
- Automatic data setup using appropriate tier
- Automatic deployment setup using appropriate tier
- Automatic validation against catalog patterns
- QA agent checks catalog compliance
- **Output**: Implementation + data setup + deployment ready + catalog updates (dev mode only)

## Context Drift Prevention

### The Problem
Traditional AI-assisted development suffers from:
- **Context Loss**: Agents forget previous decisions across sessions
- **Spec/Code Drift**: Implementation deviates from original specifications  
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different agents make conflicting architectural choices
- **Validation Gaps**: Issues discovered too late in the deployment pipeline

### The SEAD Solution
1. **Catalog Reference System**: Every component has a unique ID that preserves context
2. **Progressive Constraints**: Mode-based validation prevents drift at the source
3. **Constitutional Enforcement**: Governance rules applied consistently across all agents
4. **Assembly Line Validation**: Each tier validates the next tier's requirements

   # Activates SEAD Catalog Architect + Pattern Extraction agents
   ```
2. **Interactive Refinement**: Collaborate with agents to refine catalog quality and organization
3. **Team Adoption**: Follow agent-generated adoption strategy for team onboarding
4. **Progressive Constraint Enforcement**: Move from development to build-to-deploy mode

### For New Projects (Greenfield)
1. **Initialize with Pattern Tracking**: Start prototype development with catalog bootstrap
   ```bash
   sead catalog init --mode greenfield --track-patterns
   ```
2. **Prototype with Capture**: Build initial features while capturing reusable patterns
3. **Agent-Assisted Promotion**: Use catalog agents to evaluate and promote patterns
4. **Scale with Constraints**: Use progressive validation as project matures

### General Implementation Steps
1. **Install SEAD-METHOD**: Set up the standalone system with catalog generation agents
2. **Run Catalog Generation**: Use agent-driven analysis to extract existing patterns
3. **Configure Constraint Modes**: Set up prototype/development/build-to-deploy enforcement
4. **Team Training**: Follow agent-generated adoption strategy and workflow integration  
5. **Progressive Rollout**: Start with development mode, progress to build-to-deploy constraints

## Conclusion

SEAD-METHOD™ represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive quality assurance in AI-assisted development. By preventing drift rather than just detecting it, and by providing progressive constraint enforcement aligned across development, data, and deployment strategies, SEAD-METHOD enables teams to harness the full power of AI agents while maintaining the consistency and reliability required for production systems.

The factory assembly line approach—"paint by numbers" or "Legos rather than custom builds"—doesn't eliminate creativity. Instead, it channels creativity into the appropriate phases (prototyping and development) while ensuring production deployments meet organizational standards and requirements.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to implementation planning to transform this vision into a working system.
