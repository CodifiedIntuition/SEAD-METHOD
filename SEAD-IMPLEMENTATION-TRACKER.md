# SEAD-METHOD Implementation Tracker

**Version**: 1.4  
**Date**: 2025-01-04 (Updated)  
**Status**: Phase 4 Complete - Constitutional Framework Integration Operational  

## Project Overview

SEAD-METHOD™ (Specification Enforced Agentic Agile Development) is a **standalone replacement methodology** that absorbs the best concepts from BMAD-METHOD and Spec-Kit while adding catalog-based constraint enforcement to prevent AI agent drift.

### Key Distinction
- **NOT an integration layer** - Complete standalone replacement
- **Absorbs and replaces** all BMAD/Spec-Kit functionality
- **Unified under SEAD branding** - No references to original tools
- **Single CLI interface** - `npx sead-method [command]`
