# SEAD-METHOD Implementation Tracker

**Version**: 1.4  
**Date**: 2025-01-04 (Updated)  
**Status**: Phase 4 Complete - Constitutional Framework Integration Operational  

## Project Overview

SEAD-METHOD™ (Specification Enforced Agentic Agile Development) is a **standalone replacement methodology** that absorbs the best concepts from BMAD-METHOD and Spec-Kit while adding catalog-based constraint enforcement to prevent AI agent drift.

### Key Distinction
- **NOT an integration layer** - Complete standalone replacement
- **Absorbs and replaces** all BMAD/Spec-Kit functionality
- **Unified under SEAD branding** - No references to original tools
- **Single CLI interface** - `npx sead-method [command]`

## Session Handoff Notes

### For Next Session
1. **Primary Focus**: Continue Phase 1 foundation work
2. **Priority Tasks**: Complete project structure, begin BMAD agent extraction
3. **Context**: Building standalone SEAD replacement, not integration
4. **Key Files**: This tracker + vision/implementation plan docs

### Current Blockers
- None identified yet

### Decisions Made
- SEAD-METHOD is standalone replacement, not integration layer
- Single CLI interface with unified command structure
- Complete rebranding from BMAD/Spec-Kit to SEAD
- Three-tier constraint system as core innovation

### Next Immediate Actions
1. Complete core project structure setup
2. Begin BMAD agent extraction and conversion
3. Create basic CLI command framework
4. Test initial project initialization flow
