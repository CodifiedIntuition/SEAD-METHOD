## Overview

This document outlines the practical implementation roadmap for SEAD-METHODâ„¢ (Specification Enforced Agentic Agile Development). The plan is structured in phases to enable incremental development and validation of the system.

**UPDATE**: Phase 1 Foundation and Phase 2 Catalog Generation have both been completed successfully! SEAD-METHOD now includes the critical adoption enabler - agent-driven catalog generation from existing codebases. The implementation is significantly ahead of the original timeline.

## Implementation Philosophy

### Incremental Approach
- **Start Small**: Begin with core catalog structure and basic mode detection
- **Validate Early**: Test each component before building the next
- **Iterate Frequently**: Use feedback to refine the approach
- **Integrate Progressively**: Layer new capabilities onto proven foundations

### Build vs. Adapt Strategy
- **Leverage Existing**: Use BMAD-METHOD and Spec-Kit as foundations, not competitors
- **Extend Intelligently**: Add catalog awareness to existing agent workflows
- **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure SEAD can work with existing BMAD/Spec-Kit projects
- **Create New Where Needed**: Build new components only when adaptation isn't feasible

## Phase 0 & 2: Catalog Generation (Weeks -2 to 0) âœ… COMPLETE

### Objective âœ…

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building SEAD-METHODâ„¢ as a production-ready system. The phased approach allows for validation at each step and ensures that the system can deliver on its core promise: preventing AI agent drift through progressive constraint enforcement while maintaining the flexibility needed for effective development.

**Key Innovation**: Phase 0 (Catalog Generation) addresses the critical adoption barrier by providing tools to generate catalogs from existing codebases or bootstrap them during greenfield development. This eliminates the "cold start" problem and makes SEAD-METHOD immediately valuable to teams with existing projects.

The plan balances ambition with practicality, leveraging existing tools where possible and building new capabilities where needed. Success depends on careful execution of each phase and continuous validation of the core assumptions about how AI agents can work effectively within constraint systems.
