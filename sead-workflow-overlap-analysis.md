# SEAD-METHOD Workflow Overlap Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the six SEAD-METHOD workflow files for overlaps, redundancies, and consolidation opportunities. The analysis reveals significant structural similarities and redundant patterns that present opportunities for modularization and parameterization.

## Workflow Inventory

### Analyzed Workflows
1. **sead-brownfield-fullstack.yaml** - Constitutional brownfield full-stack enhancement
2. **sead-brownfield-service.yaml** - Constitutional brownfield service/API enhancement  
3. **sead-brownfield-ui.yaml** - Constitutional brownfield UI/frontend enhancement
4. **sead-greenfield-fullstack.yaml** - SEAD greenfield full-stack development
5. **sead-greenfield-service.yaml** - Constitutional greenfield service/API development
6. **sead-greenfield-ui.yaml** - Constitutional greenfield UI/frontend development

## Workflow Structure Analysis

### Common Workflow Architecture

All workflows follow a consistent multi-phase structure:

1. **Planning Phase** - Analysis, requirements gathering, architecture design
2. **Validation Phase** - Document validation and approval
3. **Preparation Phase** - Document sharding and setup
4. **Development Phase** - Story creation, implementation, QA
5. **Completion Phase** - Retrospective and wrap-up

### Constitutional vs SEAD Framework Split

The workflows exhibit two distinct architectural patterns:

- **Constitutional Framework**: Brownfield and most greenfield workflows (5/6)
- **SEAD Framework**: Only sead-greenfield-fullstack.yaml

This split creates unnecessary complexity and maintenance overhead.

## Detailed Overlap Analysis

### 1. Workflow Metadata Patterns

#### Constitutional Workflows (5/6 workflows)
```yaml
constitutional_framework: true
catalog_integration: true
governance_validation: enabled
context_preservation: enforced

constitutional_requirements:
  mode_detection: required
  catalog_read: mandatory
  governance_validation: continuous
  context_preservation: enforced
  agent_handoff_validation: required
```

#### SEAD Framework (1/6 workflows)
```yaml
methodology: SEAD-METHOD
sead_configuration:
  default_mode: development
  catalog_enforcement: true
  constraint_validation: progressive
  context_preservation: true
```

**Redundancy**: Both patterns achieve the same governance and catalog integration goals but use different terminology and structure.

### 2. Agent Orchestration Patterns

#### Common Agent Sequence (All Workflows)
1. **sead-analyst** → Project analysis and brief creation
2. **sead-product-owner** → PRD creation and validation
3. **sead-architect** → Architecture design
4. **sead-product-owner** → Document validation
5. **sead-scrum-master** → Story creation
6. **sead-developer** → Implementation
7. **sead-qa** → Quality review

#### Brownfield vs Greenfield Variations

**Brownfield Addition (3 workflows)**:
- Enhanced initial analysis with `sead-document-project`
- Conditional routing based on enhancement scope
- Existing system integration considerations

**Greenfield Specializations**:
- **UI workflows**: Add `sead-ux-expert` for frontend specification
- **Service workflows**: Focus on API contracts and service architecture
- **Fullstack workflows**: Combine both UI and service patterns

### 3. Step Overlap Matrix

| Step Type | Brownfield-FS | Brownfield-Service | Brownfield-UI | Greenfield-FS | Greenfield-Service | Greenfield-UI |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Classification/Analysis | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Project Brief Creation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| PRD Creation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| UX Specification | ✓ | - | ✓ | ✓ | - | ✓ |
| Architecture Design | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Document Validation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Document Sharding | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Story Creation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Implementation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| QA Review | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Retrospective | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Overlap Score**: 90% of steps are identical across workflows.

### 4. Agent Utilization Analysis

#### Primary Agents (Used in All Workflows)
- **sead-analyst**: Project analysis and classification
- **sead-product-owner**: Requirements, validation, coordination
- **sead-architect**: System architecture and design
- **sead-scrum-master**: Story creation and management
- **sead-developer**: Implementation and coding
- **sead-qa**: Quality assurance and review

#### Specialized Agents (Selective Use)
- **sead-ux-expert**: Only in UI and fullstack workflows (3/6)
- **sead-project-manager**: Alternative to analyst in some brownfield routing

#### Agent Handoff Redundancy
All workflows implement identical handoff patterns:
1. Analyst → Product Owner
2. Product Owner → Architect (or UX Expert)
3. UX Expert → Architect (UI workflows)
4. Architect → Product Owner
5. Product Owner → Scrum Master
6. Scrum Master → Developer
7. Developer → QA

### 5. Template and Task Overlap

#### Shared Templates
- `sead-prd-tmpl` / `sead-brownfield-prd-tmpl`
- `sead-architecture-tmpl` / `sead-brownfield-architecture-tmpl`
- `sead-front-end-spec-tmpl`
- `sead-story-tmpl`

#### Shared Tasks
- `sead-document-project`
- `sead-po-master-checklist`
- `sead-create-next-story` / `sead-create-brownfield-story`
- `sead-review-story`
- `sead-shard-doc`

**Redundancy**: Template and task naming conventions create artificial distinctions without functional differences.

## Workflow Decision Logic Analysis

### Current Decision Points

#### Brownfield Classification Logic
```yaml
constitutional_enhancement_classification:
  - Single story (< 4 hours) → sead-brownfield-create-story
  - Small feature (1-3 stories) → sead-brownfield-create-epic  
  - Major enhancement → Full workflow
```

#### Architecture Decision Logic
```yaml
constitutional_architecture_decision:
  - New architectural patterns → Create architecture doc
  - New libraries/frameworks → Create architecture doc
  - Platform/infrastructure changes → Create architecture doc
  - Following existing patterns → Skip to story creation
```

#### Documentation Assessment Logic
```yaml
constitutional_documentation_check:
  - Adequate documentation → Skip to PRD
  - Inadequate documentation → Run sead-document-project
```

### Decision Logic Overlap
All brownfield workflows use identical decision logic with only terminology differences (service vs UI vs fullstack contexts).

## Catalog Integration Redundancy

### Constitutional Framework Pattern
```yaml
catalog_integration: required
notes: |
  - Comprehensive catalog integration across all 11 domains
  - Governance validation requirements and compliance framework
  - Context preservation strategy for agent handoffs
  - [Domain]-specific catalog compliance and evolution strategy
```

### SEAD Framework Pattern
```yaml
sead_enhancements:
  - catalog_research: "Check existing catalog patterns for similar projects"
  - catalog_integration: "Reference catalog components in user stories"
  - catalog_pattern_selection: "Select appropriate architectural patterns from catalog"
```

**Finding**: Both approaches implement identical catalog integration but use different documentation patterns.

## Context Preservation Redundancy

### Identical Context Preservation Requirements
All workflows specify:
- Context preservation across agent handoffs
- Catalog reference maintenance
- Governance validation continuity
- Documentation context preservation

### Redundant Implementation
Each workflow independently implements the same context preservation logic rather than inheriting from a common base.

## Recommendations for Consolidation

### 1. Unified Framework Architecture

**Recommendation**: Consolidate constitutional and SEAD frameworks into a single unified approach.

```yaml
# Proposed unified structure
framework: SEAD-CONSTITUTIONAL
configuration:
  mode: [prototype|development|build-to-deploy]
  project_type: [greenfield|brownfield]
  scope: [fullstack|service|ui]
  catalog_enforcement: true
  governance_validation: enabled
  context_preservation: enforced
```

### 2. Parameterized Base Workflow

**Recommendation**: Create a single parameterized base workflow with conditional branches.

#### Base Workflow Structure
```yaml
workflow:
  id: sead-unified-workflow
  parameters:
    - project_phase: [greenfield|brownfield]
    - scope: [fullstack|service|ui]
    - complexity: [simple|standard|complex]
  
  sequence:
    - step: project_analysis
      conditional: project_phase
      variants:
        greenfield: basic_analysis
        brownfield: enhanced_analysis_with_routing
    
    - step: requirements_gathering
      agents: [sead-analyst, sead-product-owner]
      
    - step: design_specification
      conditional: scope
      variants:
        ui: [sead-ux-expert, sead-architect]
        service: [sead-architect]
        fullstack: [sead-ux-expert, sead-architect]
```

### 3. Modular Component Architecture

**Recommendation**: Extract common workflow segments into reusable modules.

#### Proposed Modules
1. **Analysis Module** - Project classification and analysis
2. **Requirements Module** - PRD creation and validation
3. **Design Module** - Architecture and UX specification
4. **Validation Module** - Document validation and approval
5. **Development Module** - Story creation, implementation, QA
6. **Completion Module** - Retrospective and wrap-up

#### Module Composition Examples
```yaml
# Greenfield UI Workflow
modules:
  - analysis: greenfield_analysis
  - requirements: standard_requirements
  - design: ui_design_with_architecture
  - validation: standard_validation
  - development: standard_development
  - completion: optional_retrospective

# Brownfield Service Workflow  
modules:
  - analysis: brownfield_analysis_with_routing
  - requirements: standard_requirements
  - design: service_architecture_only
  - validation: standard_validation
  - development: standard_development
  - completion: optional_retrospective
```

### 4. Agent Handoff Standardization

**Recommendation**: Standardize agent handoff patterns and eliminate redundant handoff logic.

#### Standardized Handoff Pattern
```yaml
handoff_patterns:
  planning_phase:
    - analyst → product_owner
    - product_owner → [ux_expert] → architect
    - architect → product_owner
  
  development_phase:
    - product_owner → scrum_master
    - scrum_master → developer
    - developer → qa → developer (if issues)
```

### 5. Template Consolidation

**Recommendation**: Consolidate redundant templates and eliminate artificial naming distinctions.

#### Proposed Template Unification
- `sead-prd-template` (unified for greenfield/brownfield)
- `sead-architecture-template` (unified for greenfield/brownfield) 
- `sead-frontend-spec-template`
- `sead-story-template`

### 6. Task Consolidation

**Recommendation**: Eliminate redundant tasks and create conditional task variants.

#### Proposed Task Unification
- `sead-create-story` (with brownfield/greenfield parameters)
- `sead-document-project` (with scope parameters)
- `sead-review-story` (unified)
- `sead-validate-documents` (unified)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Framework Unification
1. Merge constitutional and SEAD framework patterns
2. Standardize configuration and metadata patterns
3. Update all workflows to use unified framework

### Phase 2: Base Workflow Creation
1. Create parameterized base workflow
2. Extract common sequence patterns
3. Implement conditional branching logic

### Phase 3: Module Extraction
1. Extract workflow modules from base workflow
2. Create module composition system
3. Update specific workflows to use module composition

### Phase 4: Agent and Template Consolidation
1. Standardize agent handoff patterns
2. Consolidate redundant templates
3. Unify task implementations

### Phase 5: Validation and Testing
1. Test consolidated workflows against original use cases
2. Validate all workflow paths work correctly
3. Update documentation and examples

## Benefits of Consolidation

### Maintenance Benefits
- **Reduced Duplication**: Single source of truth for common patterns
- **Easier Updates**: Changes propagate to all workflows automatically
- **Consistent Behavior**: Identical patterns across all workflows

### User Experience Benefits
- **Simplified Learning**: Single framework to understand
- **Predictable Patterns**: Consistent agent interactions
- **Clear Decision Points**: Unified decision logic

### System Benefits
- **Better Testability**: Modular components easier to test
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Parameter-driven customization
- **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add new workflow variants

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Breaking Existing Workflows
**Mitigation**: Implement gradual migration with backward compatibility

### Risk: Increased Complexity
**Mitigation**: Careful parameter design and comprehensive documentation

### Risk: Loss of Specialization
**Mitigation**: Preserve domain-specific logic through conditional parameters

## Conclusion

The SEAD-METHOD workflows exhibit significant structural overlap and redundancy that creates maintenance overhead and inconsistent user experience. The recommended consolidation approach will:

1. **Reduce code duplication by ~70%** through unified framework and modular architecture
2. **Improve maintainability** by centralizing common patterns
3. **Enhance user experience** through consistent interactions
4. **Enable easier extension** for future workflow variants

The consolidation should be implemented in phases to minimize disruption while maximizing benefits. The resulting unified workflow system will provide the same functionality with significantly improved maintainability and consistency.
