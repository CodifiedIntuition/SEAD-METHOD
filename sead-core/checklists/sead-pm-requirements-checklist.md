# SEAD Project Manager (PM) Requirements Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework to ensure the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Epic definitions are complete, well-structured, and appropriately scoped for MVP development within SEAD constitutional constraints and catalog pattern compliance. The PM should systematically work through each item during the product definition process.

[[LLM: MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL INITIALIZATION - SEAD PM CHECKLIST

Before proceeding with this checklist, you MUST:

1. **Read Constitutional Constraints**: Load and read `/sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-project-manager-constraints.yaml` - these are MANDATORY guidance frameworks
2. **Review Catalog Architecture**: Load and read `/sead-catalog/*/README.md` files to understand established patterns that PRD should reference
3. **Validate Mode Context**: Determine target development mode (prototype/development/build-to-deploy) for appropriate scope and constraint planning
4. **Constitutional Framework Integration**: Ensure PRD planning incorporates constitutional compliance and catalog evolution

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. prd.md - The Product Requirements Document (check docs/prd.md)
2. Any user research, market analysis, or competitive analysis documents
3. Business goals and strategy documents with constitutional alignment considerations
4. Any existing epic definitions or user stories
5. SEAD catalog domain patterns for technical guidance integration

CRITICAL: If the PRD is missing, immediately ask the user for its location or content before proceeding.

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDATION APPROACH:

1. **User-Centric with Constitutional Context** - Every requirement should tie back to user value within constitutional constraints
2. **MVP Focus with Catalog Alignment** - Ensure scope is truly minimal while viable and catalog-compliant
3. **Constitutional Clarity** - Requirements should be unambiguous and testable within constitutional framework
4. **Catalog Completeness** - All aspects of the product vision are covered with appropriate catalog references
5. **Constitutional Feasibility** - Requirements are technically achievable within constitutional constraints

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

### Constitutional Deficiencies

(To be populated during constitutional validation)

### Constitutional Recommendations

(To be populated during constitutional validation)

### Constitutional Final Decision

- **CONSTITUTIONALLY READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design with full constitutional compliance and catalog integration.
- **NEEDS CONSTITUTIONAL REFINEMENT**: The requirements documentation requires additional constitutional work to address the identified constitutional deficiencies and catalog integration gaps.
