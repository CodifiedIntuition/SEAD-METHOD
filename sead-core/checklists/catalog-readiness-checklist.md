# SEAD Pattern Catalog Integration Readiness Checklist

This checklist provides comprehensive validation framework for determining if extracted patterns are ready for seamless catalog integration, ensuring each pattern meets catalog structure requirements, constitutional compliance standards, and organizational adoption prerequisites before catalog inclusion.

[[LLM: MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL INITIALIZATION - READ FIRST

Before proceeding with this checklist, you MUST:

1. **Read SEAD Constitutional Rules**: Load and read `/sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-pattern-extraction-constraints.yaml` - these are MANDATORY constraints that govern all catalog integration readiness validation actions
2. **Read Catalog Structure Framework**: Load and read `/sead-catalog/README.md` and domain-specific README files to understand target catalog organization and integration requirements
3. **Verify Pattern Classification**: Ensure pattern has completed quality validation via `pattern-quality-checklist.md` and has confirmed tier classification
4. **Validate Mode Constraints**: Determine development mode (prototype/development/build-to-deploy) and apply appropriate catalog integration standards

REQUIRED ARTIFACTS:
Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Completed pattern quality validation report with tier classification confirmation
2. Pattern documentation with comprehensive usage examples and implementation guidance
3. Target catalog domain structure and integration requirements
4. Pattern dependency mapping and relationship analysis
5. Constitutional framework configuration for current project mode
6. Stakeholder approval requirements and organizational integration standards

CRITICAL: If any required artifacts are missing or inaccessible, STOP and escalate to user for their location or content before proceeding.

CATALOG INTEGRATION TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the catalog integration scenario:

- **New Pattern Addition**: Adding completely new pattern to existing catalog structure
- **Pattern Enhancement**: Improving existing pattern with additional capabilities or quality
- **Pattern Migration**: Moving pattern from external source into SEAD catalog structure
- **Pattern Evolution**: Updating existing pattern with new version or significant changes

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each pattern catalog integration, you must:

1. **Catalog Compliance First** - Ensure patterns align with SEAD catalog methodology and structure
2. **Quality Gate Validation** - Confirm patterns meet tier-specific standards for catalog inclusion
3. **Evidence-Based Assessment** - Document specific integration evidence and compatibility validation
4. **Constitutional Adherence** - Apply mode-appropriate constraints for catalog integration process
5. **Reusability Confirmation** - Validate patterns provide genuine catalog value and organizational benefit
6. **Integration Impact Analysis** - Ensure catalog integration enhances rather than disrupts existing structure

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each integration aspect with detailed validation and stakeholder confirmation
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full integration readiness assessment and present detailed report]]
