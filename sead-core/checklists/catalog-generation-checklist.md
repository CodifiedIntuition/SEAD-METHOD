# SEAD Catalog Generation Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the SEAD Catalog Architect to validate catalog generation processes, ensuring high-quality, reusable patterns that align with SEAD constitutional constraints and organizational standards.

[[LLM: MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL INITIALIZATION - READ FIRST

Before proceeding with this checklist, you MUST:

1. **Read SEAD Constitutional Rules**: Load and read `/sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-catalog-architect-constraints.yaml` - these are MANDATORY constraints that govern all catalog generation actions
2. **Read Existing Catalog Structure**: Load and read `/sead-catalog/*/README.md` files to understand current catalog organization and patterns
3. **Verify Mode Constraints**: Determine if you're in prototype, development, or build-to-deploy mode and apply appropriate constraint levels for catalog generation
4. **Validate Context Preservation**: Ensure catalog generation maintains context for seamless agent handoffs

REQUIRED ARTIFACTS:
Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Source codebase or greenfield requirements for catalog generation
2. Existing catalog structure and patterns (if any)
3. Pattern extraction reports and analysis documents
4. Project technical specifications and constraints
5. Team architectural preferences and standards
6. Constitutional framework configuration for current project mode

CRITICAL: If any required artifacts are missing or inaccessible, STOP and escalate to user for their location or content before proceeding.

CATALOG GENERATION TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the catalog generation type:

- **Brownfield**: Extracting patterns from existing codebase
- **Greenfield**: Creating catalog structure for new development
- **Hybrid**: Combining existing patterns with new development needs
- **Evolution**: Extending/refining existing catalog patterns

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. **Catalog Compliance First** - Ensure generated patterns align with SEAD catalog methodology
2. **Quality Gate Enforcement** - Apply rigorous quality criteria for pattern inclusion
3. **Evidence-Based Validation** - Cite specific pattern examples and usage contexts
4. **Constitutional Adherence** - Apply mode-appropriate constraints for catalog generation
5. **Reusability Assessment** - Validate that patterns provide genuine reuse value
6. **Anti-Drift Protection** - Ensure catalog prevents architectural inconsistency

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full validation and present comprehensive report at end]]
