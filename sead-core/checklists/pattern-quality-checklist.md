# SEAD Pattern Quality Validation Checklist

This checklist provides comprehensive quality validation framework for individual patterns identified during extraction, ensuring each pattern meets tier-appropriate quality standards, constitutional compliance requirements, and catalog integration readiness before inclusion in SEAD catalog.

[[LLM: MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL INITIALIZATION - READ FIRST

Before proceeding with this checklist, you MUST:

1. **Read SEAD Constitutional Rules**: Load and read `/sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-pattern-extraction-constraints.yaml` - these are MANDATORY constraints that govern all pattern quality validation actions
2. **Read Pattern Classification Framework**: Load and read `/sead-core/data/pattern-classification.md` to understand quality tier definitions and requirements
3. **Verify Pattern Context**: Understand the source, extraction method, and proposed classification for the pattern being validated
4. **Validate Mode Constraints**: Determine development mode (prototype/development/build-to-deploy) and apply appropriate quality thresholds

REQUIRED ARTIFACTS:
Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Complete pattern documentation with implementation examples
2. Pattern classification proposal (domain, tier, complexity level)
3. Pattern usage analysis and reusability evidence
4. Constitutional framework configuration for current project
5. Related patterns and integration requirements
6. Stakeholder requirements and quality standards for current development mode

CRITICAL: If any required artifacts are missing or inaccessible, STOP and escalate to user for their location or content before proceeding.

PATTERN QUALITY TIER DETECTION:
First, determine the proposed quality tier for validation criteria:

- **Tier 1 (Foundational)**: Battle-tested, enterprise-grade patterns with comprehensive documentation and proven scalability
- **Tier 2 (Specialized)**: Domain-specific patterns with solid quality standards and clear use case boundaries
- **Tier 3 (Contextual)**: Situational patterns appropriate for specific contexts with moderate quality requirements
- **Tier 4 (Experimental)**: Emerging patterns with basic quality standards for exploration and validation

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each pattern, you must:

1. **Tier-Appropriate Quality Gates** - Apply rigorous criteria matching pattern tier expectations
2. **Evidence-Based Assessment** - Document specific quality evidence with examples and metrics
3. **Constitutional Compliance** - Validate patterns support SEAD governance framework appropriately
4. **Reusability Validation** - Ensure patterns provide genuine value proportionate to quality tier
5. **Integration Compatibility** - Verify patterns integrate well with catalog structure and related patterns
6. **Anti-Pattern Prevention** - Identify and prevent inclusion of problematic quality patterns

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each quality dimension with detailed validation
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full pattern quality assessment and present detailed report]]
