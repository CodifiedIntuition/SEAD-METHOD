# Documentation Standards Module

**Purpose:** Standard documentation requirements and artifact preparation used across all SEAD checklists.

## Documentation Framework Preparation
```
1. Identify required documentation templates for current context
2. Load applicable documentation standards and formatting guidelines
3. Confirm repository locations and file naming conventions
4. Review handoff requirements for downstream consumers
