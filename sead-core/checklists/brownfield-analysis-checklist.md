# SEAD Brownfield Analysis Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the SEAD Catalog Architect to validate brownfield codebase analysis, ensuring thorough examination of existing systems for pattern extraction and catalog generation opportunities while respecting constitutional constraints.

[[LLM: MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL INITIALIZATION - READ FIRST

Before proceeding with this checklist, you MUST:

1. **Read SEAD Constitutional Rules**: Load and read `/sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-catalog-architect-constraints.yaml` - these are MANDATORY constraints that govern all brownfield analysis actions
2. **Read Existing Catalog Structure**: Load and read `/sead-catalog/*/README.md` files to understand current catalog patterns and avoid duplication
3. **Verify Brownfield Context**: Understand the target codebase scope, technology stack, and analysis objectives
4. **Validate Mode Constraints**: Determine development mode and apply appropriate analysis depth and quality thresholds

REQUIRED ARTIFACTS:
Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Target brownfield codebase with appropriate access permissions
2. Existing documentation (architecture docs, README files, API documentation)
3. Build and deployment configuration files
4. Version control history and commit patterns
5. Test suites and quality assurance artifacts
6. Dependency manifests and third-party integration points
7. Current team knowledge and architectural decisions documentation

CRITICAL: If any required artifacts are missing or inaccessible, STOP and escalate to user for access or alternative analysis approaches.

BROWNFIELD ANALYSIS SCOPE DEFINITION:
First, determine the analysis scope and objectives:

- **Full System Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of entire codebase
- **Domain-Focused Analysis**: Analysis of specific architectural domains or components
- **Pattern Mining**: Focus on extracting reusable patterns for catalog
- **Modernization Assessment**: Analysis for system modernization and refactoring
- **Integration Mapping**: Understanding integration points and external dependencies

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each aspect of analysis, you must:

1. **Systematic Coverage** - Ensure all architectural layers and domains are examined
2. **Evidence-Based Assessment** - Document findings with specific code examples and metrics
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify both positive patterns and anti-patterns
4. **Constitutional Compliance** - Evaluate compatibility with SEAD governance framework
5. **Context Preservation** - Maintain analysis context for seamless agent handoffs
6. **Respectful Analysis** - Honor existing architectural decisions while identifying improvements

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Domain by domain (systematic mode) - Analyze each architectural domain thoroughly
- Component by component (detailed mode) - Deep dive into specific components or services
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive findings]]
