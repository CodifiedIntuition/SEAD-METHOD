# SEAD Pattern Extraction Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a quality gate framework for the SEAD Pattern Extraction Specialist to validate extracted patterns, ensuring they meet SEAD constitutional standards and provide genuine reusability value for catalog inclusion.

[[LLM: MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL INITIALIZATION - READ FIRST

Before proceeding with this checklist, you MUST:

1. **Read SEAD Constitutional Rules**: Load and read `/sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-pattern-extraction-constraints.yaml` - these are MANDATORY constraints that govern all pattern extraction actions
2. **Read Existing Catalog Patterns**: Load and read `/sead-catalog/*/README.md` files to understand established pattern formats and standards
3. **Verify Extraction Context**: Understand the source codebase or requirements from which patterns are being extracted
4. **Validate Mode Constraints**: Determine development mode and apply appropriate quality thresholds for pattern extraction

REQUIRED ARTIFACTS:
Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Source codebase analysis results or pattern identification reports
2. Extracted pattern documentation and implementation examples
3. Pattern usage frequency and context analysis
4. Constitutional framework configuration for current project
5. Existing catalog structure and domain definitions
6. Team architectural preferences and coding standards

CRITICAL: If any required artifacts are missing or inaccessible, STOP and escalate to user for their location or content before proceeding.

PATTERN EXTRACTION TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the pattern extraction approach:

- **Systematic Extraction**: Comprehensive analysis of entire codebase
- **Targeted Extraction**: Focus on specific architectural domains or components
- **Evolutionary Extraction**: Refining existing patterns based on new implementations
- **Cross-Project Extraction**: Identifying patterns across multiple codebases

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each pattern, you must:

1. **Quality Gate Enforcement** - Apply rigorous criteria for pattern inclusion
2. **Reusability Validation** - Ensure patterns provide genuine abstraction value
3. **Evidence-Based Assessment** - Document specific usage contexts and examples
4. **Constitutional Compliance** - Validate patterns support SEAD governance framework
5. **Catalog Integration** - Ensure patterns fit logically within catalog taxonomy
6. **Anti-Pattern Prevention** - Identify and exclude problematic implementation approaches

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Pattern by pattern (detailed mode) - Review each pattern individually with comprehensive validation
- Domain by domain (systematic mode) - Review all patterns within each architectural domain
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full extraction validation and present summary report]]
