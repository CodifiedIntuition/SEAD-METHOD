# SEAD Correct Course Task

## Purpose

To analyze and correct development trajectory when implementation diverges from SEAD constitutional constraints, catalog compliance, or story requirements. This task provides systematic course correction that preserves context, maintains catalog integrity, and ensures constitutional compliance while minimizing development disruption and technical debt accumulation.
