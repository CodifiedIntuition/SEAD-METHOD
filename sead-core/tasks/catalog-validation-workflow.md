3. **Issue Resolution Log**: Documentation of all issues found and their resolution status
4. **Certification Document**: Official certification status with conditions and recommendations
5. **Adoption Guide**: Final guidance for successful catalog adoption and team onboarding

## Mode Considerations

- **Prototype Mode**: Relaxed validation standards focused on learning and experimentation
- **Development Mode**: Balanced validation with reasonable quality gates and user feedback
- **Build-to-Deploy Mode**: Rigorous validation with strict quality gates and comprehensive testing

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Validation Theatre**: Going through motions without meaningful quality assessment
- **Perfectionism Paralysis**: Setting unreasonably high standards that prevent adoption
- **Single-Point Validation**: Relying on one person's assessment instead of diverse review
- **Implementation Neglect**: Validating documentation without testing actual usage
- **Context Blindness**: Validating patterns without considering real-world usage contexts
- **Adoption Barrier Creation**: Validation processes that make catalog too difficult to adopt
