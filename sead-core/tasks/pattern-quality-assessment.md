- **Build-to-Deploy Mode**: Rigorous quality validation with strict standards; zero tolerance for quality gaps

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Quality Inflation**: Artificially inflating quality scores without supporting evidence
- **Tier Misclassification**: Assigning inappropriate tiers based on wishful thinking rather than evidence
- **Stakeholder Bypass**: Proceeding without proper expert review and organizational validation
- **Quality Tunnel Vision**: Focusing on single quality dimension while ignoring others
- **Improvement Neglect**: Failing to provide actionable improvement recommendations
- **Monitoring Avoidance**: Not establishing ongoing quality monitoring and maintenance plans
- **Evidence Insufficiency**: Making quality decisions without adequate supporting evidence
