- **Development Mode**: Balance thoroughness with reasonable timeline for production use
- **Build-to-Deploy Mode**: Comprehensive validation with rigorous quality standards for enterprise use

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Expert Domination**: Allowing single experts to override team consensus without discussion
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-analyzing structure and organization without making progress
- **Premature Optimization**: Creating overly complex catalog structure before understanding usage patterns
- **Adoption Neglect**: Building catalog without adequate attention to team adoption and change management
- **Feedback Dismissal**: Ignoring developer feedback in favor of theoretical ideals

**Note**: This workflow requires extensive human collaboration and cannot be executed autonomously. Success depends on active stakeholder participation and iterative feedback incorporation.
