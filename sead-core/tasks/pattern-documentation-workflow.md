## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Documentation Incompleteness**: Missing critical sections or insufficient detail for pattern adoption
- **Example Invalidation**: Including untested or non-working examples that frustrate users
- **Template Deviation**: Inconsistent documentation structure that reduces catalog usability
- **Constitutional Non-Integration**: Missing or inadequate constitutional framework integration
- **Troubleshooting Neglect**: Insufficient troubleshooting guidance leading to pattern adoption difficulties
- **Stakeholder Bypass**: Proceeding without proper stakeholder review and approval
- **Maintenance Ignorance**: No plan for documentation maintenance and updates
- **Integration Oversight**: Missing or inadequate integration guidance for pattern adoption
