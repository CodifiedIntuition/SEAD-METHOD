# SEAD Create Simple Spec Task

## Purpose

To create concise, actionable specifications for straightforward features using SEAD constitutional constraints and catalog pattern integration. This task produces lightweight but comprehensive specifications that maintain constitutional compliance, leverage catalog patterns effectively, and provide sufficient context for implementation without the overhead of full story creation processes.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load SEAD Configuration and Validate Context

- Load `{root}/sead.config.yaml` and `{root}/sead-core/core-config.yaml` from the project root
- If files do not exist, HALT and inform the user: "SEAD configuration files not found. Run 'sead init' or 'sead catalog generate --source .' to initialize SEAD project"
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`, `workflow.*`, `catalog.*`, `modes.*`
- **SEAD Enhancement**: Load catalog patterns available for specification domain
- **SEAD Enhancement**: Validate current development mode and constitutional constraints
- **SEAD Enhancement**: Check context preservation requirements for agent handoffs
