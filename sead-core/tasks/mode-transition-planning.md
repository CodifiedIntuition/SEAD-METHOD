# Mode Transition Planning

Plan the transition between SEAD modes with explicit criteria and actions.

## Steps
1. Identify target mode and rationale
2. Assess readiness using `mode-transition-checklist.md`
3. Close gaps (catalog compliance, validation coverage, security/perf)
4. Define transition date, owners, and back-out criteria
5. Update project config (mode), communicate to teams
6. Schedule post-transition audit and QA gate checks

## Outputs
- Transition plan summary and updated milestones
