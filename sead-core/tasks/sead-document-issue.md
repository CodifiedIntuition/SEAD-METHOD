# SEAD Document Issue Task

## Purpose

To systematically document issues, bugs, and problems within the SEAD constitutional framework, ensuring comprehensive context preservation, catalog pattern impact analysis, and constitutional constraint considerations. This task creates actionable issue documentation that supports effective resolution while maintaining catalog integrity and agent handoff continuity.

  - **Integration**: Does issue impact integration pattern effectiveness or compliance?
  - **Testing**: Does issue involve test pattern failure or validation gap?

#### 2.2 Constitutional Constraint Impact Assessment

- **SEAD Enhancement**: Evaluate issue impact on constitutional constraints:
  - Mode-specific constraint violations (prototype/development/build-to-deploy)
  - Quality gate failures or validation bypass issues
  - Context preservation breakdown affecting agent handoffs
  - Governance process failures or enforcement gaps

### 3. Root Cause Analysis with SEAD Framework

  - **Pattern Incompleteness**: Catalog patterns insufficient for specific use case requirements
  - **Pattern Evolution Needed**: Existing patterns need enhancement or replacement
  - **Pattern Documentation Gap**: Pattern usage guidance insufficient or unclear
  - **Pattern Integration Failure**: Multiple patterns not integrated properly

#### 3.2 Constitutional Constraint Root Cause Analysis

- **SEAD Enhancement**: Analyze constitutional constraint failures:
  - **Constraint Awareness Gap**: Constitutional constraints not understood or communicated
  - **Constraint Conflict**: Multiple constraints creating impossible or contradictory requirements
  - **Constraint Enforcement Failure**: Validation systems not catching constraint violations
  - **Mode Inappropriate**: Current SEAD mode inappropriate for development context or requirements
  - **Process Deviation**: SEAD methodology not followed or improperly applied
