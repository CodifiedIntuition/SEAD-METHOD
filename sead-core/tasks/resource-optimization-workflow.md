# Resource Optimization Workflow

Align resources with catalog leverage and mode constraints.

## Steps
1. Establish capacity and skills matrix
2. Map tasks to catalog components vs custom work
3. Prioritize catalog-led tasks to reduce risk/time
4. Identify training needs based on catalog gaps
5. Re-sequence delivery to satisfy validation gates
6. Update plan/roadmap artifacts and communicate changes

## Outputs
- Updated plan/roadmap reflecting optimized sequencing
