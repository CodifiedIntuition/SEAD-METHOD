# User Research Planning Workflow

## Purpose
Plan user research engagements that support UX decisions while aligning with SEAD constitutional constraints and catalog objectives.

## Activation
Run when user requests research planning, validation studies, or when other tasks flag knowledge gaps requiring participant feedback.

## Dependencies
- `/sead-core/data/user-research-framework.md`
- `/sead-core/data/mode-constraint-matrix.md`
- `/sead-core/checklists/sead-ux-checklist.md`
- `/sead-core/templates/sead-user-research-plan-tmpl.yaml`
- `/sead-core/checklists/catalog-compliance-checklist.md` (for follow-up alignment)

## Workflow (Sequential)

### 1. Determine Research Need
1. Confirm project mode and associated research rigor from `mode-constraint-matrix.md`.
2. Clarify research objectives, hypotheses, and timelines with the user.
3. Identify design artifacts or open questions prompting research (wireframes, prototypes, catalog gaps).

### 2. Define Participants & Logistics
1. Reference `user-research-framework.md` for persona guidance and accessibility coverage.
2. Capture recruitment channels, screening criteria, and incentives.
3. Document consent, privacy, and data retention requirements.

### 3. Design the Study Plan
1. Load `/sead-core/templates/sead-user-research-plan-tmpl.yaml`.
2. Outline session structure, tasks, success metrics, and qualitative probes.
3. Map each research objective to specific catalog components or UX flows.
4. Define tools/platforms for conducting sessions and recording insights.

### 4. Risk & Dependency Assessment
1. Identify logistical risks (recruitment delays, tooling limitations) and mitigation strategies.
2. Determine accessibility accommodations for participants.
3. Note downstream tasks triggered by findings (prototype iteration, design-pattern-evaluation).

### 5. Output & Communication
1. Deliver populated research plan template to stakeholders.
2. Present numbered summary of objectives, participant plan, and schedule.
3. Record action items for executing the research and integrating results into UX workflows.
