# Constitutional Validation Workflow

## Purpose
Confirm product decisions and backlog adjustments comply with SEAD constitutional rules and catalog governance.

## Activation
Use before approving major decisions (sprint commitment, roadmap changes, releases) or when constraints change.

## Dependencies
- `/sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-product-owner-constraints.yaml`
- `/sead-core/data/product-strategy-framework.md`
- `/sead-core/data/catalog-pattern-priorities.md`
- `/sead-core/checklists/constitutional-compliance-checklist.md`
- Relevant task outputs (backlog prioritization, dependency analysis, sprint plan)

## Workflow (Sequential)

### 1. Establish Context
1. Identify decision being validated and stakeholders involved.
2. Note current mode and constitutional enforcement level.
3. Gather supporting artifacts (plans, metrics, catalog references).

### 2. Apply Constitutional Rules
1. Review applicable rules from `sead-product-owner-constraints.yaml`.
2. Evaluate decision against each rule; record compliance status.
3. Document any conflicts or areas needing escalation.

### 3. Validate Catalog Stewardship
1. Confirm catalog reuse/deviation data aligns with governance expectations.
2. Ensure pattern proposals follow approved workflow.
3. Assess risk of drift and mitigation plans.

### 4. Execute Checklist
1. Walk through `constitutional-compliance-checklist.md`.
2. Capture evidence, approvals, and outstanding actions.

### 5. Decision Outcome
1. Summarize findings, highlighting go/no-go recommendation.
2. Communicate results to stakeholders with numbered action list.
3. Archive validation record with references for audit trail.
