# UX Validation Workflow

## Purpose
Plan and execute validation activities (usability tests, heuristic reviews, accessibility spot checks) to confirm UX deliverables meet SEAD standards prior to handoff.

## Activation
Use when preparing to exit a UX engagement, before catalog updates go live, or when stakeholders request validation evidence.

## Dependencies
- `/sead-core/data/mode-constraint-matrix.md`
- `/sead-core/data/user-research-framework.md`
- `/sead-core/checklists/accessibility-checklist.md`
- `/sead-core/templates/sead-ux-validation-tmpl.yaml`
- Relevant artifacts (wireframe, prototype, design spec, accessibility audit)

## Workflow (Sequential)

### 1. Establish Validation Goals
1. Confirm project mode and derive minimum validation scope from `mode-constraint-matrix.md`.
2. Gather outstanding questions, risks, or success metrics from prior tasks.
3. Identify target user segments, devices, and assistive technologies to cover.

### 2. Select Validation Methods
1. Choose appropriate techniques (usability testing, heuristic review, A/B test, accessibility regression) based on goals.
2. Reference `user-research-framework.md` for methodological guidance.
3. Determine responsible parties and schedule.

### 3. Build Validation Plan
1. Load `/sead-core/templates/sead-ux-validation-tmpl.yaml`.
2. Document methods, participants, scenarios, success metrics, and acceptance thresholds.
3. Note dependencies (prototype readiness, analytics setup) and mitigation strategies.

### 4. Execute & Record Findings
1. Run planned validation activities; capture data and qualitative feedback.
2. Map findings to catalog patterns and accessibility obligations.
3. Log issues with severity, owner, and remediation due dates.

### 5. Summarize & Decide
1. Present numbered summary of outcomes, highlighting pass/fail status against acceptance thresholds.
2. Recommend go/no-go decision or required follow-up work.
3. Update stakeholders and attach validation evidence to final UX handoff materials.
