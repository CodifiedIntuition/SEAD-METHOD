# SEAD User Research Framework (Static Reference)

Applies to every SEAD UX engagement. Tailor project-specific details (participants, schedules, recordings) when executing `user-research-planning-workflow.md`.

## 1. Research Ladder by Mode
- **Prototype** – lightweight interviews or concept tests; focus on validating desirability and quick feedback loops.
- **Development** – structured usability studies, task completion metrics, accessibility checkpoints.
- **Build-to-Deploy** – formal validation, regression checks, compliance reviews, sign-off from accessibility experts.

## 2. Participant Strategy
- Identify primary personas from catalog or project brief; ensure coverage of accessibility personas.
- Maintain recruitment notes: sourcing channel, screening criteria, incentives.
- Document consent requirements and data retention policies.

## 3. Session Design
- Define research goals and hypotheses aligned with current task.
- Prepare discussion guides or test scripts; reuse standardized modules when available.
- Capture success metrics (task success rate, satisfaction rating, error frequency).

## 4. Synthesis Workflow
- Aggregate observations into themes, opportunities, and risks.
- Map findings to catalog patterns: confirm which components succeed or fail.
- Update backlog of pattern improvements or new research needed.

## 5. Handoff Expectations
- Provide summary deliverables: insights report, prioritized recommendations, next steps.
- Align findings with `ux-validation-workflow` to ensure follow-through.
- Communicate dependencies to Product, Engineering, and Accessibility stakeholders.
