# Product Strategy Framework

Provides structure for aligning backlog decisions with strategic outcomes within SEAD constraints.

## Strategic Pillars
- **Customer Value** – measurable impact on target users; reference personas and research findings.
- **Catalog Strength** – how work enhances reuse, pattern coverage, or compliance.
- **Operational Viability** – ability to deliver and maintain within mode constraints and capacity.
- **Risk Mitigation** – reduction of regulatory, technical, or process risks documented in constitutional guidance.

## Decision Matrix
| Pillar | Key Questions | Required Evidence |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Customer Value | Which persona/task benefits? What metrics improve? | Research insights, stakeholder input |
| Catalog Strength | Which catalog domains are used/extended? | Pattern references, extraction plans |
| Operational Viability | Can team deliver within current mode? | Capacity plans, dependency analysis |
| Risk Mitigation | Does work address known risks or introduce new ones? | Compliance notes, escalation plan |

## Usage Instructions
1. Evaluate each epic/story against all pillars.
2. Capture answers in backlog artifacts (use `sead-feature-spec-tmpl.yaml` and `sead-backlog-tmpl.yaml`).
3. Prioritize items that balance pillars while respecting mode constraints.
4. Revisit framework each planning cycle to incorporate new insights.
