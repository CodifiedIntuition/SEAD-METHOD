## Constitutional Compliance Requirements

### Mode-Aware Domain Application
- **Prototype Mode**: Focus on core domains (API Contracts, Shared Types, Design System)
- **Development Mode**: Progressive application of all domains with quality gates
- **Build-to-Deploy Mode**: Strict compliance with all domain standards and patterns

### Context Preservation
- Domain pattern usage must be traceable across agent handoffs
- Pattern selection rationale must be documented for governance
- Domain evolution decisions must be preserved in catalog history

### Quality Assurance
- All domain patterns must include validation criteria and success metrics
- Domain integration must be tested and validated before catalog inclusion
- Anti-patterns must be identified and excluded from domain definitions
