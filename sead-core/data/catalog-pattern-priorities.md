# Catalog Pattern Priorities Reference

Use this guide to rank backlog items based on catalog impact and strategic value.

## Priority Dimensions
1. **Reuse Amplification** – number of downstream features benefiting from the pattern.
2. **Compliance Risk Reduction** – degree to which pattern enforces constitutional rules (security, accessibility, governance).
3. **Mode Progression Support** – ability to unlock next SEAD mode or validation gate.
4. **Operational Efficiency** – reduction in delivery time or maintenance cost through standardization.

## Priority Tiers
- **Tier 1 – Foundational Patterns**: Critical catalog assets required for multiple teams (e.g., core authentication, data schemas). Must be addressed immediately.
- **Tier 2 – High-Leverage Enhancements**: Significant reuse potential or compliance uplift; schedule early in planning horizon.
- **Tier 3 – Contextual Improvements**: Targeted updates improving specific experiences; pull when capacity allows.
- **Tier 4 – Exploratory Candidates**: Prototype-mode experiments; document learnings to inform future catalog evolution.

## Backlog Application Steps
1. Classify each story/epic according to tiers above.
2. Combine with business value and effort estimates to determine scheduling.
3. Document priority rationale in backlog artifacts for transparency.
