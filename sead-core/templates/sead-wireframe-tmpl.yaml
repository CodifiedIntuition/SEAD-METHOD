  - id: screen-inventory
    title: Screen Inventory
    type: table
    columns: [# , Screen / View, Goal, Catalog Layout, Notes]
    instruction: Number each screen or major state. Reference canonical catalog layout names.

  - id: layout-structure
    title: Layout & Component Mapping
    instruction: |
      For each screen, describe the structural hierarchy and component choices using catalog terminology.
      Present mappings as numbered lists so users can select components quickly.

  - id: responsive-behavior
    title: Responsive & Adaptive Behavior
    instruction: |
      Document behavior at each breakpoint (`xs`..`xl`). Include stacking order, visibility rules, and navigation adjustments.
    content: |
      | Breakpoint | Layout Behavior | Priority Content | Interactions |
      |------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
      | xs | {{xs_behavior}} | {{xs_priority}} | {{xs_interactions}} |

      | xl | {{xl_behavior}} | {{xl_priority}} | {{xl_interactions}} |

  - id: state-coverage
    title: Interaction States
    instruction: |
      Describe expected states (idle, hover, focus, active, loading, error, empty) for critical components.
      Tie states to catalog micro-interaction patterns.
    type: table
    columns: [Component, State, Description, Catalog Reference, Accessibility Notes]

    template: "{{accessibility_actions}}"

  - id: validation-plan
    title: Validation & Next Steps
    instruction: |
      Outline remaining tasks: prototype design, research planning, accessibility audit.
      Reference checklists or workflows to execute next.
