    Unified parameterized workflow that handles all SEAD development scenarios
    through conditional logic and modular architecture. Supports greenfield/brownfield
    projects across fullstack/service/ui scopes with complete catalog integration
    and constitutional compliance.
  version: "2.0.0"
  methodology: SEAD-METHOD
  
  # Import constitutional framework base

    customizations:
      workflow_specific_validation:
        - Parameter validation for project_phase and scope
        - Conditional quality gates based on complexity
        - Agent coordination validation for multi-agent workflows
        - Catalog integration requirements per workflow path

# Agent Handoff Patterns
handoff_patterns:

    pattern: |
      {source_agent} completes {output_artifact} with catalog integration.
      Save as {file_path} in project docs/.
      {target_agent} begins {next_task} using saved artifact and catalog references.
    
  validation_handoff:
    pattern: |
      {source_agent} requests validation of {artifact} for catalog compliance.
      {validator_agent} validates using {checklist} with constitutional requirements.
      If issues found: return to {source_agent} for catalog/constraint fixes.
      If validated: proceed to {next_step} with approval documentation.
    
  conditional_handoff:
    pattern: |
      {source_agent} completes {artifact} and evaluates {condition}.
      If {condition} true: handoff to {conditional_agent} for {conditional_task}.
      If {condition} false: proceed directly to {next_agent} for {next_task}.
