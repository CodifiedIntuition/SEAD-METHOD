## Constitutional Framework

### Understanding Constitutional Constraints

Constitutional constraints are rules that govern AI agent behavior to ensure:
- **Consistency**: All agents follow the same patterns
- **Quality**: Best practices are automatically enforced  
- **Compliance**: Standards are maintained across development modes
- **Evolution**: Patterns improve over time in controlled ways

### Working with Constraints

#### Reading Constitutional Rules
```bash
# View your current constraints (automatically loaded by agents)
ls sead-core/constitutional-rules/
cat sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-developer-constraints.yaml
```

#### Mode-Specific Behavior

**Prototype Mode**:
```yaml
constraints:
  complexity: minimal
  validation: basic
  documentation: optional
  testing: smoke_tests_only
```

**Development Mode**:
```yaml  
constraints:
  complexity: progressive
  validation: comprehensive
  documentation: required
  testing: unit_and_integration
```

**Build-to-Deploy Mode**:
```yaml
constraints:
  complexity: strict
  validation: full_compliance
  documentation: comprehensive
  testing: full_suite_required
```

### Constitutional Escalation

When constraints conflict with requirements:

1. **Document the Conflict**: Clearly explain the constraint vs requirement
2. **Assess Impact**: Evaluate the implications of the conflict
3. **Escalate Appropriately**: Use established escalation procedures
4. **Get Explicit Approval**: Never bypass constraints without approval
5. **Document Resolution**: Record the decision and rationale

## Best Practices

### 🏛️ Constitutional Compliance

#### Always Read Constraints First
```bash
# Before starting any task, agents should read their constraints
cat sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-developer-constraints.yaml
```

#### Respect Mode Boundaries
- **Prototype**: Focus on rapid iteration, minimal constraints
- **Development**: Balance speed with quality, progressive constraints
- **Build-to-Deploy**: Maximum quality, strict constraints

#### Document Constraint Deviations
```markdown
## Constitutional Deviation

**Pattern**: API-001 (REST Error Responses)
**Deviation**: Custom error format for legacy system integration
**Justification**: Existing system requires specific error structure
**Approval**: [Reference to approval]
**Remediation Plan**: Migrate to catalog pattern in v2.0
```

### 📚 Catalog Usage

#### Reference Patterns Consistently
```typescript
/*
 * Catalog Reference: /sead-catalog/auth-patterns/README.md#jwt-implementation
 * Pattern ID: AUTH-003
 * Last Updated: 2025-01-05
 */
```

#### Contribute Back to Catalog
When you create reusable patterns:
1. Document the pattern thoroughly
2. Add to appropriate catalog domain  
3. Update catalog README with pattern reference
4. Submit for constitutional review

### 🤖 Agent Coordination

#### Proper Agent Handoffs
- Always document context for next agent
- Include constitutional compliance status
- Reference relevant catalog patterns
- Note any constraint challenges

#### Context Preservation
```markdown
## Agent Handoff Context

**From**: SEAD Developer
**To**: SEAD QA
**Story**: user-auth-001
**Constitutional Status**: COMPLIANT
**Catalog Patterns Used**: AUTH-003, API-001, ERR-002
**Next Actions**: Validate auth flow and error handling
**Special Notes**: Custom validation for legacy integration
```

### 🔄 Quality Gates

#### Incremental Validation
- Validate constitutional compliance at each step
- Check catalog pattern usage regularly
- Run quality gates before agent handoffs
- Document validation results

#### Continuous Improvement
- Track pattern usage and effectiveness
- Identify opportunities for catalog evolution
- Share learnings across projects
- Contribute improvements back to SEAD

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Constitutional Constraint Violations

**Problem**: Agent reports constitutional constraint violation
```
ERROR: Constitutional violation - complexity exceeds mode limits
Mode: prototype, Complexity: high, Allowed: minimal
```

**Solution**:
1. Review the constraint that was violated
2. Simplify the implementation approach
3. Or escalate to change development mode
4. Document the resolution

#### Catalog Pattern Conflicts

**Problem**: Multiple catalog patterns provide conflicting guidance
```
CONFLICT: API-001 suggests REST, INT-005 suggests GraphQL
```

**Solution**:
1. Review both patterns thoroughly
2. Consider project context and requirements
3. Choose the most appropriate pattern
4. Document the decision with rationale
5. Consider if patterns need evolution

#### Agent Coordination Issues

**Problem**: Context lost between agent handoffs
```
ERROR: Missing context from previous agent
Required: authentication implementation details
```

**Solution**:
1. Review previous agent's handoff documentation
2. Check story context and implementation notes
3. Escalate to previous agent if needed
4. Document improved handoff procedures
