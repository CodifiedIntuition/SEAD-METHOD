    title: Constitutional Framework Introduction
    instruction: |
      Before creating the project brief, establish constitutional framework context:
      
      1. **Mode Detection**: Identify current development mode (prototype/development/build-to-deploy)
      2. **Catalog Assessment**: Review existing catalog domains relevant to project scope
      3. **Constitutional Constraints**: Document governance principles applicable to this project
      4. **Context Preservation**: Plan agent handoff requirements for development workflow
      
      Ask user for mode preference and available inputs (brainstorming results, catalog references, constitutional requirements).

          - All features must align with catalog patterns or provide evolution path
          - Technical decisions must respect governance constraints
          - User stories must support constitutional compliance validation
          - Architecture must enable context preservation across agent handoffs
