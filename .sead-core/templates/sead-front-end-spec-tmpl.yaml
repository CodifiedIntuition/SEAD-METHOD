    instruction: |
      Review constitutional documents with catalog integration awareness:
      
      1. **Context Review**: Access SEAD Project Brief, SEAD PRD, SEAD Architecture Document
      2. **Catalog Assessment**: Review design-system catalog patterns and UI constraints
      3. **Constitutional Compliance**: Ensure UI/UX choices support governance framework
      4. **User Research Integration**: Validate user needs align with constitutional principles
      
      Before proceeding, analyze catalog-compliant UI patterns and governance requirements.

      This document defines the constitutional user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for {{project_name}}'s user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and constitutional frontend development, ensuring a cohesive, user-centered, and governance-compliant experience.
      
      **Constitutional Framework Integration**: All UI/UX decisions must align with SEAD constitutional principles and support catalog pattern evolution. This specification enforces progressive constraint validation and context preservation for seamless agent handoffs.
