# SEAD Verify Build Task

## Purpose

To comprehensively validate that build outputs comply with SEAD constitutional constraints, catalog pattern requirements, and deployment readiness standards. This task ensures that build artifacts meet progressive validation criteria, maintain catalog pattern integrity, and preserve context for deployment and maintenance phases while preventing technical debt accumulation.
