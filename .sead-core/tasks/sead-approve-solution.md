# SEAD Approve Solution Task

## Purpose

To systematically evaluate and approve technical solutions using SEAD constitutional constraints, catalog pattern compliance, and progressive validation criteria. This task ensures that proposed solutions align with catalog patterns, meet constitutional requirements, and preserve context for implementation and future maintenance while balancing innovation with consistency.
