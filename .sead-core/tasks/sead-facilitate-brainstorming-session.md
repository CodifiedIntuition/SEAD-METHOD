# SEAD Facilitate Brainstorming Session Task

Facilitate interactive, catalog-aware brainstorming sessions with constitutional compliance. Be creative and adaptive in applying techniques while maintaining catalog integration and SEAD governance principles.

## Constitutional Compliance

### Pre-Session Requirements
- **Mandatory Catalog Read**: Review relevant catalog domains before session setup
- **Mode Detection**: Identify current development mode (prototype/development/build-to-deploy)
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain catalog references throughout brainstorming process

### Mode-Specific Brainstorming Constraints

#### Prototype Mode
- **Open Exploration**: Allow ideas beyond catalog boundaries
- **Innovation Focus**: Encourage experimental and breakthrough concepts
- **Pattern Discovery**: Capture potential catalog additions
- **Simple Documentation**: Record experimental patterns for evaluation

#### Development Mode
- **Catalog-Informed Ideation**: Guide ideas toward catalog-compatible solutions
- **Integration Focus**: Explore how ideas integrate with existing catalog
- **Migration Pathways**: Consider transition strategies for new patterns
- **Structured Documentation**: Organize ideas by catalog domain alignment

#### Build-to-Deploy Mode
- **Catalog-Only Solutions**: Restrict ideation to catalog-compliant approaches
- **Implementation Focus**: Generate actionable ideas within constitutional constraints
- **Compliance Validation**: Ensure all ideas meet governance requirements
- **Production Documentation**: Create implementation-ready specifications

## Process

### Step 1: SEAD Session Setup

Ask 6 context questions (don't preview what happens next):

1. What are we brainstorming about? (Include catalog domain context if known)
2. Any constraints or parameters? (Constitutional, technical, or catalog-related)
3. Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation within catalog context?
4. Current development mode? (prototype/development/build-to-deploy)
5. Relevant catalog domains? (API, types, UI, state, etc.)
6. Do you want a structured document output with catalog integration? (Default Yes)

### Step 2: Present Catalog-Aware Approach Options

After getting answers to Step 1, present 4 approach options (numbered):

1. User selects specific techniques with catalog awareness
2. SEAD Analyst recommends catalog-informed techniques based on context
3. Constitutional constraint-guided technique selection
4. Progressive catalog-aligned technique flow (explore → validate → integrate)

### Step 3: Execute Techniques with Constitutional Compliance

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

- **CATALOG-AWARE FACILITATOR**: Guide user to generate ideas that consider catalog integration
- **CONSTITUTIONAL GUIDANCE**: Maintain awareness of SEAD governance principles
- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Keep user engaged while respecting mode constraints
- **CONTEXT PRESERVATION**: Maintain catalog references throughout session
- **CAPTURE OUTPUT**: Document all ideas with catalog domain mapping

**Technique Selection with Catalog Context:**
If user selects Option 1, present numbered list of catalog-enhanced techniques. Each technique includes:
- Core brainstorming method
- Catalog integration guidance
- Constitutional compliance notes
- Mode-appropriate constraints

**Technique Execution with SEAD Framework:**

1. Apply selected technique with catalog awareness according to current mode
2. Guide ideation within appropriate constitutional constraints
3. Map generated ideas to relevant catalog domains
4. Keep engaging until user indicates they want to:
   - Choose a different technique
   - Apply ideas to catalog integration analysis
   - Move to constitutional compliance validation
   - End session

**Output Capture with Catalog Integration (if requested):**
For each technique used, capture:

- Technique name, duration, and mode context
- Key ideas generated with catalog domain mapping
- Constitutional compliance considerations
- Integration points with existing catalog patterns
- User's reflections on catalog alignment

### Step 4: SEAD Session Flow

1. **Constitutional Warm-up** (5-10 min) - Build creative confidence within SEAD framework
2. **Catalog-Informed Divergent** (20-30 min) - Generate ideas with catalog awareness
3. **Constitutional Convergent** (15-20 min) - Group and validate against governance principles
4. **Catalog Integration Synthesis** (10-15 min) - Align concepts with catalog patterns

### Step 5: SEAD Document Output (if requested)

Generate structured document with constitutional compliance and catalog integration:

**Executive Summary**

- Session topic and goals with catalog context
- Techniques used with constitutional compliance notes
- Total ideas generated and catalog domain coverage
- Key themes aligned with SEAD governance principles

**Constitutional Framework Context**

- Development mode and constraint implications
- Relevant catalog domains and integration points
- Governance principle alignment assessment
- Mode-specific validation outcomes

**Technique Sections** (for each technique used)

- Technique name and catalog-aware description
- Ideas generated (user's own words) with domain mapping
- Constitutional compliance insights
- Catalog integration opportunities and challenges

**Catalog-Aware Idea Categorization**

- **Catalog-Ready Solutions** - Immediate implementation with existing patterns
- **Catalog Extension Opportunities** - New patterns requiring catalog evolution
- **Constitutional Innovations** - Ideas enhancing SEAD governance framework
- **Cross-Domain Integration** - Solutions spanning multiple catalog domains
- **Mode Progression Ideas** - Concepts supporting prototype→development→deploy progression

**Constitutional Action Planning**

- Top 3 priority ideas with catalog alignment rationale
- Next steps including constitutional compliance validation
- Catalog evolution or pattern creation needs
- Timeline considerations within SEAD governance framework

**SEAD Integration Reflection**

- How ideas support catalog evolution and governance principles
- Areas for further catalog domain exploration
- Recommended follow-up techniques with constitutional guidance
- Questions emerged for future SEAD-compliant sessions

## Key SEAD Principles

- **CATALOG-AWARE FACILITATION**: Guide user to consider catalog integration throughout
- **CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE**: Maintain governance awareness in all ideation
- **INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE**: Ask questions building on catalog context and constraints
- **MODE-SENSITIVE ENGAGEMENT**: Adapt technique application to current development mode
- **CONTEXT PRESERVATION**: Maintain catalog references across technique transitions
- **INTEGRATION FOCUS**: Draw connections between ideas and existing catalog patterns

**Core Facilitation Guidelines:**
- Maintain energy while respecting constitutional constraints
- Defer judgment during generation within mode-appropriate boundaries
- Aim for catalog-informed quantity leading to constitutional quality
- Build on ideas with catalog integration awareness
- Document everything with domain mapping and compliance notes

## Advanced SEAD Engagement Strategies

**Constitutional Energy Management**

- Check engagement within governance framework: "How does this align with our catalog constraints?"
- Offer technique switches respecting mode boundaries
- Celebrate idea generation that advances catalog evolution
- Balance creative freedom with constitutional compliance

**Catalog Depth vs. Constitutional Breadth**

- Deepen ideas with domain context: "How would this integrate with our API patterns?"
- Use "Yes, and within catalog..." to build on ideas constitutionally
- Help make connections: "How does this relate to our design system catalog?"
- Guide toward catalog-compatible solutions when in development/deploy modes

**Mode-Sensitive Transition Management**

- Always validate mode appropriateness before technique switches
- Offer constitutional compliance checks: "Should we validate this against catalog patterns?"
- Respect user process while maintaining SEAD governance
- Guide toward appropriate mode transitions when ideas require different constraints

## Escalation Procedures

**Constraint Conflicts:**
- If ideas conflict with catalog constraints, offer constitutional alternatives
- Explain governance boundaries and provide compliant options
- Guide toward catalog evolution opportunities when appropriate

**Mode Transition Needs:**
- If ideation requires different mode, explain constitutional implications
- Support user through governance-compliant mode transitions
- Maintain catalog context during mode changes

**Catalog Evolution Opportunities:**
- If session identifies significant catalog gaps, document for future evolution
- Connect to appropriate SEAD agents for catalog enhancement consideration
- Maintain constitutional compliance while exploring new patterns

## Success Criteria

- All brainstorming maintains appropriate level of catalog awareness for current mode
- Ideas are documented with clear catalog domain integration points
- Constitutional compliance is preserved throughout creative process
- Session outcomes support both innovation and governance objectives
- Context preservation enables effective handoff to implementation phases
