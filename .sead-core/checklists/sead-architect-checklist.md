# SEAD Architect Solution Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the SEAD Architect to validate the technical design and architecture before development execution. The Architect must systematically work through each item, ensuring the architecture is robust, scalable, secure, and aligned with the product requirements while strictly adhering to SEAD constitutional constraints and catalog patterns.

[[LLM: MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL INITIALIZATION - READ FIRST

Before proceeding with this checklist, you MUST:

1. **Read SEAD Constitutional Rules**: Load and read `/sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-architect-constraints.yaml` - these are MANDATORY constraints that govern all your actions
2. **Read Catalog Architecture**: Load and read `/sead-catalog/*/README.md` files to understand established patterns for all domains
3. **Verify Mode Constraints**: Determine if you're in prototype, development, or build-to-deploy mode and apply appropriate constraint levels
4. **Validate Catalog Compliance**: Every architecture decision must reference and align with existing catalog patterns

REQUIRED ARTIFACTS:
Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. architecture.md - The primary architecture document (check docs/architecture.md)
2. prd.md - Product Requirements Document for requirements alignment (check docs/prd.md)
3. frontend-architecture.md or fe-architecture.md - If this is a UI project (check docs/frontend-architecture.md)
4. All catalog domain README files from `/sead-catalog/`
5. Any system diagrams referenced in the architecture
6. API documentation if available
7. Technology stack details and version specifications

CRITICAL: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, STOP and escalate to user for their location or content before proceeding.

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

- Does the architecture include a frontend/UI component?
- Is there a frontend-architecture.md document?
- Does the PRD mention user interfaces or frontend requirements?

If this is a backend-only or service-only project:

- Skip sections marked with [[FRONTEND ONLY]]
- Focus extra attention on API design, service architecture, and integration patterns
- Note in your final report that frontend sections were skipped due to project type

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. **Catalog Compliance First** - Check proposed patterns against established catalog standards
2. **Deep Analysis** - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
3. **Evidence-Based** - Cite specific sections or quotes from documents and catalog patterns when validating
4. **Constitutional Adherence** - Apply mode-appropriate constraints (strict for build-to-deploy, flexible for prototype)
5. **Risk Assessment** - Consider what could go wrong with each architectural decision
6. **Anti-Drift Protection** - Validate that architecture decisions maintain consistency with catalog patterns

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]
