# SEAD Product Owner (PO) Master Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the SEAD Product Owner to validate project plans before development execution within constitutional constraints and catalog pattern compliance. It adapts intelligently based on project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and includes UI/UX considerations when applicable.

[[LLM: MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL INITIALIZATION - SEAD PO MASTER CHECKLIST

Before proceeding, you MUST:

1. **Read Constitutional Constraints**: Load and read `/sead-core/constitutional-rules/sead-product-owner-constraints.yaml` - these are MANDATORY validation constraints
2. **Review Catalog Standards**: Load and read relevant `/sead-catalog/*/README.md` files to understand established patterns for validation
3. **Validate Constitutional Context**: Apply constitutional compliance requirements throughout validation process
4. **Assess Catalog Integration**: Ensure all plans integrate properly with established catalog patterns

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

1. Is this a GREENFIELD project (new from scratch)?
   - Look for: New project initialization, no existing codebase references
   - Check for: prd.md, architecture.md, new project setup stories

2. Is this a BROWNFIELD project (enhancing existing system)?
   - Look for: References to existing codebase, enhancement/modification language
   - Check for: brownfield-prd.md, brownfield-architecture.md, existing system analysis

3. Does the project include UI/UX components?
   - Check for: frontend-architecture.md, UI/UX specifications, design files
   - Look for: Frontend stories, component specifications, user interface mentions

CONSTITUTIONAL DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Based on project type, ensure you have access to:

For GREENFIELD projects:
- prd.md - The Product Requirements Document with constitutional compliance
- architecture.md - The system architecture with catalog pattern references
- frontend-architecture.md - If UI/UX is involved with catalog design patterns
- All epic and story definitions with constitutional validation

For BROWNFIELD projects:
- brownfield-prd.md - The brownfield enhancement requirements with constitutional constraints
- brownfield-architecture.md - The enhancement architecture with catalog integration
- Existing project codebase access with constitutional compliance assessment (CRITICAL)
- Current deployment configuration and infrastructure details with catalog validation
- Database schemas, API documentation, monitoring setup with constitutional compliance

CONSTITUTIONAL SKIP INSTRUCTIONS:
- Skip sections marked [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] for greenfield projects
- Skip sections marked [[GREENFIELD ONLY]] for brownfield projects  
- Skip sections marked [[UI/UX ONLY]] for backend-only projects
- Note all skipped sections in your final constitutional report

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. **Constitutional Analysis First** - Thoroughly analyze each item against constitutional constraints and catalog compliance
2. **Evidence-Based with Catalog References** - Cite specific sections or code when validating with catalog pattern references
3. **Constitutional Critical Thinking** - Question assumptions and identify constitutional gaps
4. **Constitutional Risk Assessment** - Consider what could go wrong with each decision within constitutional framework

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:
- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present constitutional report at end]]
